# Tunetent

The web was originally meant to be a collection of pages that are static, open, and accessible. I'm among those who wants to [#MakeTheWebHTMLAgain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tefielQeHZY).

Tunetent is a 100% free and opensourced alternative to [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com), with pages written entirely in HTML and CSS. This all means that any artist, even with very minimal understanding of web development, can customize their own fork of Tunetent as little or as much as they want, with no restrictions whatsoever. This project merely provides a very basic framework with which anyone can paint their own musical canvas, so to speak.

## album.html

This is where the digital magic comes to life in a certain sense. Much like a Bandcamp album/single page, this page is where you embed the tunes, link to details and/or lyrics about said tunes, write the liner notes, etc.

## artlab.html

Short for "Artist and/or Label", this is where you put links to different things in the form of hyperlink-pictures that you populate the page with. What sort of things? Lots of sorts of things. If used as an artist page, you can link to different albums and singles. If used as a label page, you can do the same with links to different artists. Hell, you could do just about anything. If you wanted to sprinkle in links to releases on other websites or physical merchandise, feel free; anything goes. Take that, bandcamp! :P

## Licensing

You can fork this website and do just about whatever with it. That's basically redundant at this point, silly. However, this project is licensed under version 2 of the GNU GPL, meaning that you need to preserve this freedom in your fork(s) of this project. Don't worry, though. All the kool katz are doing this freedom thing, so you totally should too. Any music content or other assets of yours that you put into your fork of Tunetent can be licensed under whatever you want, so long as the anyone can freely access and utilize the source code (HTML/CSS).
